"Ode to Pizza"
by ChatGPT

Oh, pizza round, a savory delight,
With crust that’s crisp, or soft as night.
Upon your dough, a work of art,
Each bite a joy that warms the heart.

Tomato sauce in scarlet streams,
A river rich, the taste of dreams.
Mozzarella, stretched and fine,
Strings of gold in every line.

Pepperoni spiced just right,
Or veggies fresh, a vibrant sight.
Mushrooms, olives, onions, too,
A world of flavors just for you.

Whether deep or thin you be,
You carry warmth and unity.
In every slice, the world feels bright—
Oh, pizza, you’re pure, shared delight.

And when the crust has all been gone,
We crave your taste and carry on.
For every meal or midnight treat,
Your circle brings us joy complete.
